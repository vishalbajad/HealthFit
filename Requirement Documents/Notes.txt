** Bundle and minify static assets in ASP.NET Core
** used HTTPS for secure connection
** Sanitize File Names
** Set File Storage Location: 
** Secured File Upload ENdpoint with JWT

Technology Used :
Framework : .NET Core 7
Front End : .NET Razor Pages 
Back End Service : .NET 7 Web API
Database : Sql Server
Design Pattern : Repository Design Patterns , The Repository Design Pattern is a widely used design pattern in software development, particularly in the context of data access and persistence. after considering following reason , we have use the Repository Design Pattern:
Separation of concerns
Abstraction of data access logic
Centralized data access logic
Encapsulation of querying and persistence operations
Testing and mocking
Flexibility in data storage implementations
Standardization and consistency


Security :
Encrypted User password stoared in database ( Salt and hashed password)
AntiForgeryToken for razor pages
URL Encoding to send parameters over server
Used Https protocol
JWT Authentication for APIs
Separate File Server with token based file access 
We can use checksum to verify no duplicate file has saved
