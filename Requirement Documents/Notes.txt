Design Pattern : Repository Design Patterns , The Repository Design Pattern is a widely used design pattern in software development, particularly in the context of data access and persistence. after considering following reason , we have use the Repository Design Pattern:
Separation of concerns
Abstraction of data access logic
Centralized data access logic
Encapsulation of querying and persistence operations
Testing and mocking
Flexibility in data storage implementations
Standardization and consistency
